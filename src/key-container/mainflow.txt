generate master seed (mnemonic): using bip39 => mnemonic => encrypt mnemonic => store in local storage
encryption key: generated by using pbkdf2 256 times using sha512 hash function, salt = 'salt' => encode in base64
key generate: key pair is derived from mnemonic with path: m/44'/0'/0 (hdKey library) => encrypt both key and store in localStorage
encrypt: using nacl lib, message is encrypted with nonce, result = nonce + encrypted message
